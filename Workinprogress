Observations and Improvements I feel:

1. EDA: Understanding different attributes and choosing what are all the attributes to be a part of Model building with proper reasoning. 
One of the easiest ways to figure out the most likely influencing Independent variables to our Target variable: 
using Bi-variate analysis( each independent vs Target) 
2. Highlighting the presence of highly correlated variables using correlation matrix and then stating none of highly correlated variables 
    to be dropped, as PCA has a way to handle highly correlated variables. 
3. None of the variables are being dropped in this approach - Need to figure out the variables to be dropped. 
4. Overall inferences from EDA are very limited and requires lot of improvement. 
5. Need to highlight the presence of highly correlated variables using correlation matrix. 
  Inferences from Pair plot analysis are missing. 
6. Model building using PCA components could have been also explored to compare the performance between both models
  (one with PCA components and one without PCA components i.e. with original features). 
7. This model is clearly showing a fluke accuracy i.e. 100% and this might be due to data leak or over-fitting.
